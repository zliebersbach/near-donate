/**
 * Now you can write some tests! In local sandbox mode, each `workspace.test` will:
 *
 *   - start a new local blockchain
 *   - copy the state from the blockchain created in `Workspace.init`
 *   - get access to the accounts created in `Workspace.init` using the same variable names
 *   - run concurrently with all other `workspace.test` calls, keeping data isolated
 *   - shut down at the end, forgetting all new data created
 *
 * It's also worth knowing that `workspace.test` is syntax sugar added by
 * near-workspaces-ava. With raw AVA + near-workspaces, here's how to write a test:
 *
 *     import avaTest from 'ava';
 *     import {Workspace} from 'near-workspaces';
 *     // Alternatively, you can import Workspace and ava both from near-workspaces-ava:
 *     // import {ava as avaTest, Workspace} from 'near-workspaces-ava';
 *
 *     const workspace = Workspace.init(...);
 *
 *     avaTest('root sets status', async test => {
 *       await workspace.fork(async ({contract, root}) => {
 *         ...
 *       });
 *     });
 *
 * Instead, with the syntax sugar, you can write this as you see it below â€“
 * saving an indentation level and avoiding one extra `await`.
 * (Extra credit: try rewriting this test using the "sugar-free" syntax.)
