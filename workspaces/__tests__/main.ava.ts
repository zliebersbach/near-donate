/**
 * Welcome to near-workspaces-ava!
 *
 * This is a working test which checks the functionality of [the status-message
 * contract][1]. For quick reference, here's the contract's implementation:
 *
 *     impl StatusMessage {
 *         pub fn set_status(&mut self, message: String) {
 *             let account_id = env::signer_account_id();
 *             self.records.insert(&account_id, &message);
 *         }

 *         pub fn get_status(&self, account_id: String) -> Option<String> {
 *             return self.records.get(&account_id);
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * As you can see, this contract only has two methods, a setter and a getter.
 * The setter sets a status message for the account that signed the call to the
 * contract. The getter accepts an `account_id` param and returns the status for
 * that account.
 *
 * The tests below create a local blockchain with this contract deployed to
 * one account and two more accounts which store statuses in the contract.

/**
 * Now you can write some tests! In local sandbox mode, each `workspace.test` will:
 *
 *   - start a new local blockchain
 *   - copy the state from the blockchain created in `Workspace.init`
 *   - get access to the accounts created in `Workspace.init` using the same variable names
 *   - run concurrently with all other `workspace.test` calls, keeping data isolated
 *   - shut down at the end, forgetting all new data created
 *
 * It's also worth knowing that `workspace.test` is syntax sugar added by
 * near-workspaces-ava. With raw AVA + near-workspaces, here's how to write a test:
 *
 *     import avaTest from 'ava';
 *     import {Workspace} from 'near-workspaces';
 *     // Alternatively, you can import Workspace and ava both from near-workspaces-ava:
 *     // import {ava as avaTest, Workspace} from 'near-workspaces-ava';
 *
 *     const workspace = Workspace.init(...);
 *
 *     avaTest('root sets status', async test => {
 *       await workspace.fork(async ({contract, root}) => {
 *         ...
 *       });
 *     });
 *
 * Instead, with the syntax sugar, you can write this as you see it below â€“
 * saving an indentation level and avoiding one extra `await`.
 * (Extra credit: try rewriting this test using the "sugar-free" syntax.)
